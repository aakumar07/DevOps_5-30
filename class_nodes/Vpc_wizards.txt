
VPC Wizards

Wizards simplifies our VPC, IGW , routing tables , subnets, security group and NAT and NATGATEWAYconfigurations.

Currently we have 4 types of wizards

VPC with public subnet

VPC with public and private subnet

VPC with Public and Private Subnets and Hardware VPN Access

VPC with a Private Subnet Only and Hardware VPN Access.

Hardware VPN Access :

VPN : virtual private network..

Hardware VPN Access : Network people -->>> create VPN create ==>>> link generate ===>> vpn link.

VPN link ==>> the purpose of vpn link to connecting the client's network..

Every project has one vpn link..

How to access the vpn link ???

vpn link ==>> click ==>>>> username and password ===>> second level security ===>>> RSA token ===>> 6 digits ( every one minit==>> change) ===>> after entering the 6 digits ==>> now you are in clients network..

username and password ==>>> networking people ==>> email to us..

How to access / connect application instances in your organization ???

Note : you must be connect with vpn link..

1. ramakrishna ==>> IBM ==>> client ==>> DBS ==>> singapore.

2. ramakrishna ==>> need to login into the AWS account.

3. Admin team ===>>> for ramakrishna they will create one aws account.

4. ramakrishna will login into the AWS account with username and passowrd. ==>>> second level security. ( MFA ==>> multifactor authentication).

second level security ==>>> 2 ways..

1. mobile number.===>> OTP ==>>> 6 digits number =>> enter ==>> now you are in AWS account.

2. we need to install mobile app ==>>> google authenticator ==>>> AWS account ==> QR code ==>> SCAN ==>> 6 digits number ==>> enter ==>> now you are in AWS account.

IMportant key point :

1. Jump servers / jump instances  / bastion host ===>> security.

every project has 5 to 7 jump servers.

2. Application instances ===>>> EU.

first you need to login into jump server ==>>> after that you need to login into application instances..


jumpserver ==>>> 192.168.5.10 ==>>> IPaddress ==>> through putty we will connect jumpserver.

now you are in jump server. ==>> through ssh we will connect application instances..

ssh -i /tmp/central.pem ec2-user@appinstanceIP( elastic / private ) ==>> enter ==>>> now you are in application instance.
